# Surviving-The-Grid (Python)
Problem Solving by Searching using IDA* and Best First Search

## Problem statement: 
You are stranded somewhere on an 11x8 grid. The green dot in the below figure
represents your present location on the grid. You are low on food and water and you are running out of
energy to survive. Going from one cell to the next consumes one unit of your precious energy. Needless
to say, you have an urgent need to exit this grid in as few steps as possible. There is only one cell through
which you can exit the grid and that cell is represented by the blue arrow. The grid also has some barriers
which you cannot cross but can go around. You can only move right, left, up and down to a cell which is
within the grid and which is not a barrier.

The environment is static, fully observable and deterministic.
Although odds are stacked against you, all hope is not lost. You are an intelligent agent and have good
understanding of various search algorithms using which you can exit the grid
